Maybe you don't spend all your time in front of a screen, and maybe one day you would like to grow a vegetable garden.
Maybe it's even the time to do it right now, since Potageome allows you to know which vegetables positively interact.
It's interactive interface (written in D3.js) displays positive and negative interactions between vegetables, taking into account parasites and auxiliary organisms.

The project in still a work in progress, initiated by Thibault Lorin, and might one day fires up online. Maybe, maybe...
